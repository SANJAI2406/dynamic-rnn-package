It works by dividing the range of each parameter into 'n' intervals and placing exactly one sample in each. The 'Optimized' process ensures the final sample is the best possible by selecting the one with the most uniform coverage. (See the 'Algorithms' section for a deep dive).\n\n"

Just like flipping a coin 10,000 times won't give you exactly 5,000 heads, a random sample will have a mean that is extremely close to, but not perfectly identical to, the theoretical target.
